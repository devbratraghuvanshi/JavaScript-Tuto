// Abstraction means hiding the inner implementation details and showing only outer details. 
// To understand Abstraction we need to understand Abstract and Interface concepts from Java. 
// But we don't have any direct Abstract or Interface in JS. 

//In Jquery we will use
$("#ele")

//to select select an element with id ele on a web page. Actually this code calls negative JavaScript code
document.getElementById("ele");

// But we don't need to know that we can happy use the $("#ele") without knowing the inner details of the implementation.
